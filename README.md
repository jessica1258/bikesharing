# Bike Sharing Analysis

## Overview of Analysis

### Purpose of Analysis
The intent of this analysis is to support presentations to potential investors in a bikesharing program in Des Moines. The focus of the presentation is on analysis of data from a current bike sharing service in New York City.

### Approach
To conduct this analysis, we used a database from August 2019 for the NYC Citi Bike program and analyzed the data to understand ridership in that program. To ensure the data was usable, it was reformatted to ensure the correct data types were available. Then Tableau Public was used to 

## Results
### Key Findings
After reviewing a series of data images for the NYC Citi Bike program, , the following observations were made.

- The mean temperature reading was 74.9 degrees in June and 71.0 degrees in December, a relativly small difference indicating that June is somewhat warmer than December.
- In reviewing the minimum and maximum temperatures, we see that minimum temperatures vary more significantly than the maximum temperatures. In June, the lowest measurement taken was 64.0 degrees, while Decembers coldest reading was 56.0, which is an 8 degree difference. The maximum readings for the two months were only 2.0 degrees different, at 85.0 and 83.0 for June and December, respectively. 
- The minimum temperature difference may be indicative of outliers readings in December because the 25% quartile for the two months show less variability, similar to the mean and maximum temperature. The 25% readings ar 73.0 degrees and 69.0 degrees for June and December, respectively. This represents a 4 degree difference.
